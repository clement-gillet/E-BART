Implementation of the Master Thesis [Leveraging Event Relation Extraction for Abstractive Summarization of Narratives: A Transformer-based Approach](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10BZcmVW58vcf13cZb0YOeEtXjysA3_Wk/view?usp=sharing), by Cl√©ment Gillet, 2023.

This repo contains all the code related to my **Master Thesis Research**. The **research question** is the following: 

"In the **narrative domain**, can we **improve performance of transformer-based summarizers**, i.e. quality and controllability of summaries, **by leveraging Event Relations** in the input document?"
